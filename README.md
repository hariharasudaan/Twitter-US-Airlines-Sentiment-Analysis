# Twitter-US-Airlines-Sentiment-Analysis

A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline.

Link to the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment#Tweets.csv

We will be creating a ULMFiT model that can possibly perform sentimental analysis by classifying the tweets for the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset.

Virgin America, United, Southwest, Delta, US Airways and American Airlines are the six airline companies for which the analysis will be performed. We will train the model to identify whether the tweets are positive, neutral or negative. This task would be very challenging without ULMFiT due to the size of the dataset. Since, the tweets are lesser in length we have very little information and the dataset itself is unbalanced (The number of Negative reviews is greater than the combined count of positive and neutral reviews).

Thanks to ULMFiT for providing us with a great concept to work when we have lesser data to perform sentimental analysis.

Let's Go!
